# Prequisites
* Python 3.11
* Pytest framework + Requests library

# How to run
Open console, navigate to the PetStore folder where *main.py* is located, type *pytest main.py* and hit Enter

# Additional info
* 3 tests are failing as they should be. Some tests are failing ambiguously, probably due to how api handles responses.
* Endpoints for Pet handled, the rest would be similar.
